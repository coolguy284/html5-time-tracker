Can choose to follow either MIT or Unlicense; MIT made available in case
Unlicense does not legally apply in your jurisdiction.

Note: the repository license of MIT+Unlicense does not apply to
"scripts/lib/file_import_export.js" function importDataFromFile, lines 23-40.
It is modified and improved from stackoverflow as the comment inside it
indicates, and thus presumably is CC-BY-SA 3.0 for the original answer and
CC-BY-SA 4.0 for the edit to the answer.

Note: the file "scripts/constant_css_colors.js", lines 4-169 lists the
CSS colors taken from the W3C standard (referenced by the comment above it),
and "info/formats/storage_v3.0_binary.md" lines 205-372 lists the CSS colors
taken from the W3C standard (referenced by the comment above it) along with
their rgb values. It is unclear what the licensing on this might be. If the
source standards are public domain than this note can be disregarded entirely
and the 2 files referenced follow the same license as the rest of the repository.
Otherwise, it is unclear what the licensing is.
